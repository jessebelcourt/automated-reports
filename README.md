# Automated Reporting System

A custom crafted reporting system built for an accounting department for the purpose of aggregating, storing, and displaying useful information about accounts with failed credit card transactions in a specified time period. Since this data was not being stored at the time, custom backend storage mechanisms were constructed.

So this data could can be viewed on demand, an interface was built using some modern front-end web technologies. The data in the table is sortable on multiple columns, and dynamically updated to represent the data you are viewing.

The report is made available in multiple downloadable formats.
